# Gistify Pitch Deck

## 1. Problem
Short-form and long-form content is exploding — YouTube videos, reels, blogs, tweets.

Users often lack time to watch or read everything, yet still want to understand what it's about.

Current solutions (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) require manual copy-pasting and are not optimized for fast, focused summarization.

Educators, researchers, and casual users alike need a streamlined, minimal interface to get the gist.

## 2. Solution
Gistify is a lightweight platform that takes any public link to a video, post, or article — and returns a clear, contextual summary.

### Key Features:

- Paste a link and instantly get:
  - **About** – What is this?
  - **Gist** – What’s the core idea?
  - **Related To** – Topics/domains/people
- Optimized interface for clarity and speed.
- No data is stored; designed for privacy-first usage.

## 3. Target Users
- Students and educators who want to take quick notes from educational content.
- Casual users who want to understand viral content without watching the full piece.
- Professionals who use video/blogs as part of their daily research or learning flow.

## 4. Why Now
- Rapid growth of short-form video and information overload.
- AI summarization is finally accurate enough to provide real utility.
- Growing demand for accessible, no-login tools focused on minimalism.

## 5. Competitive Advantage
Unlike general-purpose chat interfaces:
- **Purpose-built UI**: Clean, distraction-free, no prompts required.
- **Content-aware**: Handles reels, videos, articles, and social content with format-specific logic.
- **Modular LLM Integration**: Switch between OpenAI, Claude, TinyLLM, or Ollama — user choice in future versions.
- **Edge-friendly Design**: Exploring local LLMs and Whisper to run fully offline or on-device.

## 6. Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TailwindCSS
- **Backend (modular)**:
  - Whisper (transcription)
  - OpenAI or local LLMs (summarization)
- **Planned Deployment**: GitHub Pages (frontend), Localhost/Cloud APIs (backend)

## 7. Roadmap
**V1**
- Paste link, fetch and summarize using OpenAI or TinyLLM
- Show About, Gist, Related sections

**V2**
- Sentiment analysis: Useful, Debatable, Not Useful
- Copy & Save options
